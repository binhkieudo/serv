GCIO site IOB_X1Y328
ERROR: [Place 30-172] Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and PLL pair. If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.
	< set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE [get_nets i_clk_IBUF] >

	i_clk_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IPAD_X2Y162
	clock_gen/PLLE2_BASE_inst (PLLE2_ADV.CLKIN1) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on PLLE2_ADV_X1Y4

	The above error could possibly be related to other connected instances. Following is a list of 
	all the related clock rules and their respective instances.

	Clock Rule: rule_pll_bufg
	Status: PASS 
	Rule Description: A PLL driving a BUFG must be placed on the same half side (top/bottom) of the device
	clock_gen/PLLE2_BASE_inst (PLLE2_ADV.CLKOUT0) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on PLLE2_ADV_X1Y4
	wb_clk_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y31

Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The PLL is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
